Imagine want to grab 22 JSON structures of cats from this api -> https://cataas.com/cat?json=true which returns a single random cat image JSON, 
without fetching more than 3 concurrently - that is, you can only have 3 concurrent HTTPS requests running at a time, 
but you should still optimize for speed. The API returns a random JSON structure that represents a cute cat picture. 
The problem is similar to one we run into all the time: Upload 10's of thousands of images to AWS S3, for example,
without exceeding the limits of the network on the machine doing the uploading.
